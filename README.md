## Castor - Indel-aware phylogenetic tree inference

----

Castor is a phylogenetic tree inference software that implements a new class of
indel-aware substitution models in the Maximum Likelihood framework.

There are two stories about the origin of the name Castor. The first one:

> Indels leaves traces of their presence on the alignment in the form of small (or big)
> stretches of gap characters (-), thus generating sequence alignments made of several
> unconnected segments. These marks resemble those left by beavers (lat. genus name Castor)
> on logs and trees, which they use to build dams and lodges. Since sequence
> alignment and tree inference are two interdipendent inference steps, we pictured
> our indel-aware (the nibbles) phylogeny inferring software as a beaver (Castor)
> nibbling at the (phylogenetic) trees in the attempt of building a damn.
