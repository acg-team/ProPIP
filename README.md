#### Licence

     * ProPIP is a computer program whose purpose is to infer phylogentic trees
     * under indel-aware and indel-non-aware substitution models for nucleotide,
     * protein, and codon datasets
     *
     * This software is based and extends the following libraries:
     *
     * - the Bio++ libraries
     *   developed by the Bio++ Development Team <http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr>
     *
     * - The Tree Search Heuristic Library (TSH-LIB)
     *   developed by L. Gatti & M. Maiolo <http://bit.ly/tsh-lib>
